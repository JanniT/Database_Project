# Database Project

For a school course.

More comprehensive documentation can be found under `doc/` directory.

## Usage

### Interface

Interface script is located on the root of the repository and can be run
with `./interface.py`.

Requires `sqlite` python library to be installed.

Tests are run under bash, so won't work on Windows.

### Database

The .sql file that creates the database, and fills it with dummy data is 
included in the `db/` directory.
